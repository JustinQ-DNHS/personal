## Wedenesday
We did a write up for the Frog Popper activity and also were notified of a poster project related to the Frog Popper key ideas which were: 
- What potential energy is and where i can be found.
- What kinetic energy is and where it can be found
- What total mechanical energy is and where it can be found
- That energy is conserved (but can be transformed)
- What work is and where it happens
- How energy and work are interrelated to one another  

We also worked on a worksheet which covered calculating work on an object.

Discussed how to calculate work, which is:  
w=F\*d\*cos() = work = Force * distance * cos(angle between d and F)  
\* *Note to self: Calculate force using gravity\*kg*
