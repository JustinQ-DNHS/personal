## Monday
### Introduction
I was introduced to the class since I was demoted (;-;) and are now with new people for the first time ever, people asked me questions such as:  
- 你有女朋友？
- 你喜欢吃什么食物？
- 你喜欢吃什么水果？
- 你有弟弟吗？(从我弟弟)
- 什么游戏我喜欢玩？

### Word Chain Game
We played the word chain game as well, it's a game thats popular in asian languages where you chain words together based on the sound they make, for example 食物 (ShiWu) would chain with 时间 (ShiJian) or 午饭 (WuFan). I had heard about the game for hapanese in No Game No Life so of course I had a lot of fun playing it in Chinese, I had played it before in English as well which made it even better. My only sadness was that there weren't enough people chaining 家人 (JiaRen) with 加油 (JiaYou)

We also learned how to say numbers larger than 999, that is 千 (Qian), if you were paying attention you would've also learned that 万 (Wan) is the level after that, the format would be 五万五千五百五十五 (WuWanWuQianWuBaiWuShiWu) or 55555

## Wednesday
### Main Lesson
林老师 was out so we had to learn on our own. We had to go through three tasks for credit. We had to listen to the Lesson 7, Dialogue 1 video and complete the L7 D2 text analysis, and then submit the written answers and a video to canvas. Then we had to complete a Padlet and write in our journal new words in an ad page for housing.

#### Padlet
I decided to work on the Padlet first since I don't have a textbook for the class, the first question wanted you to make a sentence with the pattern 只要。。。就 (ZhiYao...Jiu) which funamentally means, as long as they have <text>______</text> they are <text>______</text>.  
The next question was to make a sentence using the sentence pattern 只有。。。才 (ZhiYou...Cai). This basically means If it is <text>______</text> they will <text>______</text>.  
Finally we had the final question which was to make a sentence using the sentence pattern 凡事。。。都 (FanShi...Dou) which basically means As long as <text>______</text> is true, I will think <text>______</text>.  
Some examples on how to use these sentence patterns:

#### Textbook Work
The final thing to do was to watch a video on Lesson 7 Dialogue 1 and do a text analysis of Lesson 7 Dialogue 2. A video was referenced to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/gD-JmZGhsW0?si=NNZ2tMk8OL5FrFvJ">here</a>. Then we have to watch another video of a bunch of College students re-enacting the book. Which is always fun.
