## Monday
### Introduction
I was introduced to the class since I was demoted (;-;) and are now with new people for the first time ever, people asked me questions such as:  
- 你有女朋友？
- 你喜欢吃什么食物？
- 你喜欢吃什么水果？
- 你有弟弟吗？(从我弟弟)
- 什么游戏我喜欢玩？

### Word Chain Game
We played the word chain game as well, it's a game thats popular in asian languages where you chain words together based on the sound they make, for example 食物 (ShiWu) would chain with 时间 (ShiJian) or 午饭 (WuFan). I had heard about the game for hapanese in No Game No Life so of course I had a lot of fun playing it in Chinese, I had played it before in English as well which made it even better. My only sadness was that there weren't enough people chaining 家人 (JiaRen) with 加油 (JiaYou)

We also learned how to say numbers larger than 999, that is 千 (Qian), if you were paying attention you would've also learned that 万 (Wan) is the level after that, the format would be 五万五千五百五十五 (WuWanWuQianWuBaiWuShiWu) or 55555
