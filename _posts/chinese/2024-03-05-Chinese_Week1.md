## Monday
### Introduction
I was introduced to the class since I was demoted (;-;) and are now with new people for the first time ever, people asked me questions such as:  
- 你有女朋友？
- 你喜欢吃什么食物？
- 你喜欢吃什么水果？
- 你有弟弟吗？(从我弟弟)
- 什么游戏我喜欢玩？

### Word Chain Game
We played the word chain game as well, it's a game thats popular in asian languages where you chain words together based on the sound they make, for example 食物 (ShiWu) would chain with 时间 (ShiJian) or 午饭 (WuFan). I had heard about the game for hapanese in No Game No Life so of course I had a lot of fun playing it in Chinese, I had played it before in English as well which made it even better. My only sadness was that there weren't enough people chaining 家人 (JiaRen) with 加油 (JiaYou)
